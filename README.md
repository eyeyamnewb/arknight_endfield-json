hello, and welcome to the endfield dataset repository, 

i got addicted to playing endfield thanks to its factory aspect , played the game since it was on release week.
thanks to that addiction i made a simple dataset to be used with large language model to calculate and do optimization to my factory.
for now the dataset is just a simple one but primarily its consist of production recipe for AIC units.

feel free to use this for your own projects , and if you like feel to contribute to it as well, im letting everyone to access this dataset to let it grow cause im lazy :3
you may use it for any ai related project for it aswell either for training or RAG, in the loving memory of Tata

sincerely, operator eyeyamnewb (uuid:4131203657)
